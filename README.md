#  The Tiny Project: FindingTheMostFrequentThing

This is the most frequently visited problem in developing a business app.
I hope to compare the various methods to assess the perforamnce.

The most visited value or thing is, however, 'String' which is the associatedType `TargetSearch` in this project.

* Purpose: Because the algoritm is so rudimentary that all seasoned Swift engineers will easily understand this level of this tiny project.
but I just want to push this project, I have to show that I'm not a starter in Swift language.
I've been working iOS games with Swift/ObjC langauges for 10 years. In the viewpoints of companies in other industries, they don't know how hard it would be, making an adventure game with full features of aritificial intelligence.

This is the reality.

* Note:  most of my works need more stringent copyright protection that can not be in public.
